                <p>Roger Federer has bowed out of the Australian Open with a shock four-set loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas.

                    Federer's chances of winning a third consecutive Australian Open title were ended as the 20-year-old
                    came of age on Rod Laver Arena.

                    The Greek, who was not born when Federer made his professional debut, has rapidly established
                    himself as one of the most exciting up-and-coming talents in the game and backed it up spectacularly
                    with a 6-7 (11) 7-6 (3) 7-5 7-6 (5) victory to move through to a first slam quarter-final.</p>

                <p>For the first time all evening, Tsitsipas looked overwhelmed as he stepped out for the on-court
                    interview, saying: "I'm the happiest man on earth right now. I cannot describe it.
                    "From the very beginning it was very important to keep that mindset, to believe in yourself, believe
                    in your capabilities.

                <p>"Roger is a legend of the sport, so much respect for him. He showed such good tennis over the years.
                    I've been idolising him since the age of six.
                    "It was a dream come true just being on Rod Laver facing him. Winning at the end, I cannot describe
                    it."
                    "I had an aggressive mindset from the start, stayed in the moment, got first serves in and tried to
                    press. I didn't lose my patience and that was the key.
                    "I showed fighting spirit and had most of the crowd supporting me. I haven't seen such a large crowd
                    all my life. The atmosphere, the vibes and the energy shown to Roger and me today was
                    indescribable."
